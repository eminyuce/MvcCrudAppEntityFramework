Asp.Net MVC Simple CRUD Application
A simple Asp.net MVC CRUD application with Entity Framework Code-First Approach. I tried to develop it as simple as I can to make it understandable CRUD is an acronym for the four basic types of SQL commands: Create , Read , Update , Delete.

Upload necessary packages and set up connection string properly.

Sql script for product table and stored procedure is inside the project, inside App_data folder.
